# Docker Volume – Complete Practical Guide

## 📌 What is Docker Volume?

Docker Volume is a persistent storage mechanism used to store data outside the container lifecycle.

Containers are **ephemeral (temporary)**.  
If a container is deleted, its internal data is lost.

Volumes solve this problem by storing data on the host machine.

# 🧠 Why We Use Docker Volumes?

- To prevent data loss
- To persist database data
- To store logs permanently
- To maintain data during container recreation
- To support CI/CD redeployments

---

# 🏗 Without Volume

Container → Data  
Delete Container → ❌ Data Lost  

---

# 🏗 With Volume

Container → Volume → Host Storage  
Delete Container → ✅ Data Safe  

---

# 🔹 Step-by-Step Practical

## 1️⃣ Create a Volume

```bash
docker volume create practice-volume

Check volumes:

docker volume ls
2️⃣ Run Container with Volume
docker run -it --name volume-test -v practice-volume:/data ubuntu

Inside container:

cd /data
echo "Docker Volume Test" > file.txt
ls
exit
3️⃣ Delete Container
docker rm volume-test
4️⃣ Run Again with Same Volume
docker run -it --name volume-test2 -v practice-volume:/data ubuntu

Check:

cd /data
ls
cat file.txt

✅ File will still exist.

🔍 Where Docker Stores Volume Data?

Check volume details:

docker volume inspect practice-volume

You will see something like:

Mountpoint: /var/lib/docker/volumes/practice-volume/_data

Check host path directly:

ls /var/lib/docker/volumes/practice-volume/_data
🗑 Remove Volume

⚠️ Make sure container is removed first.

docker rm volume-test2
docker volume rm practice-volume
🔥 Important Docker Volume Commands
Purpose	Command
List volumes	docker volume ls
Create volume	docker volume create name
Inspect volume	docker volume inspect name
Remove volume	docker volume rm name
Remove unused volumes	docker volume prune
📦 Named Volume vs Bind Mount
Named Volume (Recommended)
-v volume-name:/container-path

Docker manages storage automatically.

Bind Mount
-v /host/path:/container/path

Uses a specific host directory.

🚀 CI/CD Use Case

In Jenkins pipeline:

Every deployment:

Container is removed

Container is recreated

Without volume → Data loss
With volume → Data persists

🎯 Interview One-Line Answer

Docker volumes are used to persist container data by storing it outside the container lifecycle, ensuring data safety even if the container is deleted or recreated.

✅ Summary
Action	Data Status
Container Restart	Safe
Container Delete	Safe
Volume Delete	Lost
